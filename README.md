# JavMasters
Java based dice rolling game, loosely based on dicemasters

The player will have a pool of health which they will attempt to deplete by collecting and building their dice.

My initial plan is to set up a player object, which will have a health pool and a collection of dice.
I will then go forward in creating various dice collections which will represent states of play for those dice.
I will then work on the impact of the dice in those collections.
